# Inventory-Management-System
Class project to develop business-facing, graphical inventory management application. Applies the Model-View-Controller (MVC) software application format on a JavaFX program. Complete with functionality to add, remove, and modify unique data types called "parts" and "products", where a product is a collection of parts. Each individual interface has data entry validation, and upon modify existing entries, the interface will automatically populate the data fields with the pre-existing data from the inventory database.
